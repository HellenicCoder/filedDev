## Prompt 1
I want to create a shopping list Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The extension should let users save the URL of the current browser tab.

When a user opens the Chrome extension on a page with an item they like, 
they should be able to select a category and then click a "Save Item" button 
to add the tab's URL to a list displayed below. The shopping list should display 
each item's link next to the category.

The categories to select should be "Books, Clothes, Shoes, Electronics, Pets, Health".

Please suggest a step-by-step guide to help me get started.
